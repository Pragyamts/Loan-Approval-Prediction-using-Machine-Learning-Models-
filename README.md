# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning Models
This repository contains the project files for the Loan Approval Prediction analysis, conducted to evaluate financial and demographic factors influencing loan approval decisions. The objective of this project is to develop predictive models to assist financial institutions in assessing credit risk effectively.
## Project Overview
In the financial sector, loan approval decisions are critical and involve evaluating various financial and demographic parameters. This project leverages statistical learning algorithms to predict loan approval status based on a dataset of 20,000 synthetic records. It compares the performance of three models:
-Logistic Regression

-Support Vector Machine (SVM)

-Random Forest Classifier
## Key Objectives:
-Identify significant predictors of loan approval.
-Develop, train, and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
-Compare model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC.
-Analyze feature importance to understand the drivers of loan approval.
